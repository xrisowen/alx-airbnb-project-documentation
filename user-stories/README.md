### User Story (Human-Centered Design):

User stories serve as reminders that our goal is not just to build features, but to solve real problems for real people. A well-crafted user story keeps the team aligned with the userâ€™s needs, ensuring design and development efforts deliver meaningful value.
They also foster better collaboration: designers know what to prioritize, developers understand the expected behavior, and stakeholders gain visibility into the purpose and reasoning behind every decision.
